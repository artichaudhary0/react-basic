# React Basic 40+ Projects

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It contains 40+ basic React projects to help you get started with learning React and web development.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
For more information, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It optimizes the app for the best performance and minifies the build. Your app is ready for deployment!  
For deployment details, refer to [Create React App's deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: This is a one-way operation!**  
If you eject, you won't be able to go back.  
It removes the single build dependency from your project and gives you full control over configuration files and dependencies (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint).  
You may eject if you need advanced configuration.
